                    <p>Paria Theatre is a place for people to explore their ideas and creativity in a safe space. It’s a place to play and be a kid again. It’s a place where anyone is welcome.</p>

                <div class="whatis-blurb-bodytext">
                    <p>The ambition of Paria Theatre is to be a hub of imagination and delight by creating theatre through improvisation. This means that we play with the hilariously funny and the heartbreakingly sad, often at the same time. We put community at the heart of what we do and take care to support everyone who joins us no matter what. We pride ourselves on giving everybody an opportunity.</p>

            <div class="history-blurb-opener">Paria Theatre was born out of a love of grounded and realistic Improv, that took its time to make real and interesting characters.</div>
               <div class="history-blurb-bodytext">
                It started out as Paria Exchange, a double act between founders Ben Macpherson and Gareth Hughes in 2015. They liked what they found so much that they wanted to get other people involved to play with what they had found so Paria Theatre was born. Paria Exchange is still one of the headline shows of Paria Theatre.

                Paria Theatre is built on the idea that nothing is funnier than the truth and in all shows there is an element of real life that acts as the seed to what follows.</div>
           <div class="whyParia-blurb-bodytext">
           This means that there is always something personal and relatable at the heart of Paria Theatre shows. By starting from a point of truth there is no need to invent elaborate premises or high concepts. This makes Paria Theatre very approachable for new people and beginners. We focus on finding the interesting elements of a scene and following them to a humorous place rather than quipping with large surreal caricatures. The result is a type of improv that anyone can learn and enjoy.
